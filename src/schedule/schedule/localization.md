# Globalization and Localization

The Scheduler integrates different date-time formats and cultures, which allows it to function globally, thus meeting the diverse needs of different regions.

You can adapt the Scheduler to various languages by parsing and formatting the date or number ([`Internationalization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/internationalization/)), adding culture specific customization and translation to the text ([`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/localization/)).

## Globalization

The Internationalization library provides support for formatting and parsing the number, date, and time by using the official [`Unicode CLDR`](http://cldr.unicode.org/) JSON data and also provides the `loadCldr` method to load the culture specific CLDR JSON data.

By default, Scheduler is set to follow the English culture ('en-US'). If you want to go with different culture other than English, follow the below steps.

* Install the `CLDR-Data` package by using the below command (it installs the CLDR JSON data). For more information about CLDR-Data, refer to this [link](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/json).

```cmd
npm install cldr-data --save
```

Once the package is installed, you can find the culture specific JSON data under the location `node_modules\cldr-data`.

* Now use the `loadCultureFiles` method to load the culture specific CLDR JSON data.

Refer the culture files directly from `node_modules\cldr-data` location as like the below code example.

```sh
    function loadCultureFiles(de) {
        var files = ['ca-gregorian.json', 'numbers.json', 'timeZoneNames.json'];
        var loader = ej.base.loadCldr;
        var loadCulture = function (prop) {
            var val, ajax;
            ajax = new ej.base.Ajax(location.origin + '/../node_modules/cldr-data/main/' + name + '/' + files[prop], 'GET', false);
            ajax.onSuccess = function (value) {
                val = value;
            };
            ajax.send();
            loader(JSON.parse(val));
        };
        for (var prop = 0; prop < files.length; prop++) {
            loadCulture(prop);
        }
    }
```

* Set the culture to Scheduler by using the `Locale` property.

{% aspTab template="schedule/localization/internationalization", sourceFiles="data.cs"  %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Localizing the static Scheduler text

[`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/localization/) library allows to display all the static text, date content, and time mode of the Scheduler following the localized language. To achieve this, set the `Locale` property of Scheduler, as well as define the translation text of static words of Scheduler through the `load` method of `L10n` class.

For example, the following code example lets you to define the Hungarian translation words for all the static words used in Scheduler.

{% aspTab template="schedule/localization/localization", sourceFiles="data.cs"  %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Setting date format

Scheduler can be used with all valid date formats and by default it follows the universal date format "MM/dd/yyyy". If the `DateFormat` property is not specified particularly, then it will work based on the locale that is assigned to the Scheduler. As the default locale applied on Scheduler is "en-US", this makes it to follow the "MM/dd/yyyy" pattern.

{% aspTab template="schedule/localization/dateformat", sourceFiles="data.cs"  %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Time mode

The time mode of the Scheduler can be either 12 or 24 hours format which is completely based on the `Locale` set to the Scheduler. Since the default `Locale` value of the Scheduler is en-US, the time mode will be set to 12 hours format automatically.

## Displaying Scheduler in RTL mode

The Scheduler layout and its behavior can be changed as per the common RTL (Right to Left) conventions by setting `EnableRtl` to `true`. By doing so, the Scheduler will display its usual layout from right to left. It's default value is `false`.

{% aspTab template="schedule/localization/rtl", sourceFiles="data.cs"  %}

{% endaspTab %}
